# Let's start exploring....!

As a Front-end Developer, I'm excited to share with you the latest features in Bootstrap 5.3.0. In Bootstrap 5.3.0, we can expect several enhancements and improvements. One area that Bootstrap consistently focuses on is the grid system. With each update, the grid system becomes more flexible and customizable, allowing developers to create responsive layouts with ease.

# List of new features.

* [Dark mode support](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/#dark-mode)
    
* [Custom color modes support](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/#custom-color-modes) themes beyond light and dark
    
* [Extended color palette](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/#refreshed-color-palette) for theme colors that adapt to color modes
    
* [New link helpers](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/#new-link-helpers-and-utilities), link utilities, and focus ring helpers
    
* [New nav underline](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/#new-nav-underline) variant
    

Beyond all the color mode updates, new helpers, and new utilities, we have a ton of other quality-of-life updates in this release. Here’s a quick rundown of the highlights:

* Navs now have new `:focus-visible` styles that better match our custom button focus styles.
    
* CSS variable-based `border-width` utilities have been reverted to set their property directly (as was done before v5.2.0). This avoids inheritance issues across nested elements, including tables.
    
* Added new `.border-black` utility to match our `.text-black` and `.bg-black` utilities.
    
* Deprecated the `.text-muted` utility and `$text-muted` Sass variable. It’s been replaced by `.text-body-secondary` and `$body-secondary-color`.
    
* Added a check for interpolated variables to catch compilation errors with Node Sass when using Sass variables in `calc()` functions.
    
* Started using `--bs-border-radius` variables across more components.
    
* Added `.d-inline-grid` utility class.
    
* Fixed `.tooltip-inner` placement when using variations in `fallbackPlacements`.
    
* Fix selectors for dark mode carousel overrides when compiling with `$color-mode-type: media-query`.
    
* Updated the styling of floating labels when “floated” to include a `background-color` to help with multiple lines of text in `textarea`s. This also fixes the colors when form elements are disabled in floating forms.
    
* Updated RFS to v10.0.0.
